# Approximation-of-Hamiltonian-Path
This algorithm looks for an approximate result (local maximum) for the problem of the Hamiltonian Path, involves the techniques observed in the Kruskal algorithm. **The time complexity of the present algorithm is O (E log E)**, with "E" as the number of edges.

## Additionally
If you look for the edge that closes the cycle, you can also consider it as a local solution for the **Hamiltonian Cycle** problem, related to the TSP. To carry out this step it is necessary that the digraph can form at least one cycle.
