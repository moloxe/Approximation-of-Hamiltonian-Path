# Approximation-of-Hamiltonian-Path
This algorithm looks for an approximate result (local maximum) for the problem of the Hamiltonian Path, involves the techniques observed in the Kruskal algorithm. **The time complexity of the present algorithm is O(n log n)**, with "n" as the number of nodes.

## Additionally
* If you look for the edge that closes the cycle, you can also consider it as a local solution for the Hamiltonian Cycle problem, related to the TSP.
* Requirements: A list of edges with enough quantity to form at least one cycle.
